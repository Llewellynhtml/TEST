    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With a robust foundation in Economics, research, and Econometrics, I've honed an analytical lens for problem-solving, driving me toward innovative solutions in diverse fields. My journey has now veered into the dynamic world of web development and coding, an endeavor fueled by a passionate commitment to my start-up ambitions. This new path isn't just about expanding my professional toolkit; it's about integrating my skills to create impactful, digital experiences. Amid these ventures, my love for cooking simmers on, serving as both a personal sanctuary and a source of inspiration. Currently, I'm channeling this passion into a unique project: designing a website dedicated to the art of cooking and the joy of food. This platform is a reflection of my journeyâ€”a blend of analytical rigor, technological innovation, and the simple pleasures that cooking brings into our lives.   </p>
